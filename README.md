# Collab-app

It's a project management website very similar in style to something like Asana.

But a little bit more simplified, will not say now to rival any of those big companies,

but this project will be a really good step in the right direction.

It's going to allow you and a bunch of work colleagues to collaborate on projects.

Chat to each other.

Assign each of the tasks and all that kind of jazz.

And on top of that, we're adding this little feature on the right hand side, which

lists all the Currently online users.

Anyone online has a little green circle next to their name.
